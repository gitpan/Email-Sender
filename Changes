          make Wrapper transports proxy is_simple and allow_partial_success to
          the wrapped transport

          allow Wrapper transports to construct their own targets; useful for
          configuring entire wrapper chain from the environment

1.300002  2013-02-06 14:06:24 America/New_York
          THIS IS A BIG DEAL:  see v1.300000

          increase version of Moo to interoperate with ancient Mouse.pm

1.300001  2013-01-07 21:38:31 America/New_York
          increase required versions of Throwable and Moo

1.300000  2013-01-02 22:42:58 America/New_York
          THIS IS A BIG DEAL:

          use Moo instead of Moose (thanks to Justin Hunter and Christian
          Walde!)

0.120002  2012-09-11 14:43:07 America/New_York
          added shift_deliveries to the Test transport, for treating the
          sent messages like a queue of things to inspect

0.120001  2012-07-19 16:28:01 America/Los_Angeles
          no changes from 0.120000, just marked as stable release

0.120000  2012-05-08 20:53:43 America/New_York
          THIS IS A BIG DEAL:

          This release deprecates the scalar context behavior of:

          * Failure->recipients
          * Failure::Multi->failures
          * Failure::Multi->recipients
          * Transport::Test->deliveries
          * Transport::Failable->failure_conditions

          Until now, these methods returned a list in list context and
          an array reference in scalar context.  This still works, but
          scalar context calls will now generate a warning.  In one
          year (2013-05), they will be become fatal.

0.110005  2012-03-05 21:37:35 America/New_York
          binmode output handle to avoid line ending munging in Mbox and

0.110004  2012-02-21 17:47:35 America/New_York
          import the "Bcc" page from the (otherwise empty) github wiki; this
          adds some information to the QuickStart page about why Bcc support
          isn't there and why this isn't a bug

0.110003  2012-02-01 15:09:52 America/New_York
          add the add_lines_header and add_envelope_headers attributes to
          Maildir transports

0.110002  2012-01-31 17:02:35 America/New_York
          Maildir deliveries now have a ->filename method to tell you just
          where the mail was delivered

0.110001  2011-04-03 16:32:15 America/New_York

          prevent Test::MinimumVersion test from causing a requirement on T::MV
          and, thus, PPI!  Thanks for the report, Matt S. Trout!

0.110000  2011-03-17 21:40:36 America/New_York

          no code changes
          remove prereq of Test::More 0.88; weird things happened

          THIS RELEASE MAY BREAK YOUR CODE... but probably not

          Email::Sender::Simple has been added, along with a manual
          Email::Sender is now a role
          Email::Sender::Transport is now a role, too; subclasses will break

0.004     2009-03-24
          require perl5 version 8
          move to Moose; let's not mess around, the Moose/Mouse stuff is not
          worth the minor savings

0.003     2009-03-12
          Sendmail transport now uses 2-arg open on Win32 so it can work at all
